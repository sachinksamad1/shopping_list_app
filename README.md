# Flutter Shopping List App 🛒
A simple and elegant shopping list application built with Flutter. This app allows users to browse a list of products fetched from a remote API, add items to their personal shopping list, and view the total cost. It serves as a great example for practicing basic data handling, state management, and API integration in Flutter.
